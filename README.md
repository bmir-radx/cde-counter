# CDE Counter

This script counts variables used by each study as listed in the RADx Data Hub variable report. It separates the variables by tiers (Tier 1 CDEs, Tier 2 CDEs, and other data elements), and then saves the result to CSV. Example usage:

```bash
python count_cdes.py -i variable-report.xlsx -o counts.csv
```

Variable reports of the expected format can be downloaded from the [variables catalog](https://radxdatahub.nih.gov/variablesCatalog) at the RADx Data Hub. An example variable report is included at `data/12-01-2024Complete-Data-Variable-Report.xlsx`. References for tiered data elements can be found in the `data/` directory. These are generated by parsing the tier-2 data dictionaries (found [here](https://github.com/bmir-radx/radx-tier2-data-elements)) and by enumerating mappings defined by the RADx Global Codebook (found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1famf1rpRpLz3Q-rLJ5t-pEbetPWasxsK/edit?gid=1843357815#gid=1843357815)).
